# Project Rules

## Project Structure
- All configuration files must be placed in the `home/` directory
- Platform-specific configuration files must be in appropriate subdirectories
- Templates must use the `.tmpl` extension

## File Naming Conventions
- Configuration files must start with `dot_` or `private_dot_`

## Documentation Requirements

## Security Guidelines
- Sensitive information must be stored in private files (prefix `private_`)
- Passwords and tokens must never be committed
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure compatibility across supported platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Test configurations on all supported platforms
- Document platform-specific behavior differences

## Maintenance
- Use Renovate for automatic dependency updates
- Maintain an up-to-date package list in `packages.toml`
