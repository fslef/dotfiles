# Default settings for amethyst
# Repo: `https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst`
#
# Note due to issue 1419 (https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/issues/1419) some
# config values may conflict and not work if they are the same as the default
# values for amathyst. You can see these values on github at
# https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst/blob/development/Amethyst/default.amethyst
# If you're experiencing conflicts and the settings are the same as the default,
# comment out the commands in this file.
#
# Move this file to: `~/.amethyst.yml`
# In order to register changes restart Amethyst.
# If you experience issues pulling in the changes you can also quit Amethyst and run: `defaults delete com.amethyst.Amethyst.plist`
# This removes the current preferences and causes Amethyst to restart with default preferences and pull configs from this file.
